			<h3>WRITER BOOSTER</h3>
			
			<br />
			
			<h4>Writer Booster offers everything you'd expect from a simple Pomodoro timer and then some:</h4>
			
			<br />

<p>It lets you adjust the lengths of your focus and break sessions.
The timer switches automatically from focus to break time.
Your data syncs across Focus Booster's web, mobile, and desktop apps.
But what really makes Focus Booster unique are the features in its Professional plan that let you use the tool as both a Pomodoro timer and time-tracking app.</p>

<p>Before starting a focus session, add/select a task and client to attribute the time to. When you finish the session, Focus Booster logs the time, task, and client to your timesheet. Then, your Reports dashboard shows a snapshot of your timesheet and revenue for selected dates. You can even download detailed CSV reports for simpler invoicing.</p>

<p>Another useful feature: pause your timer at any time if you're interrupted and need to quit tracking your time. When you're ready to refocus, restart the timer to log the time from the unfinished session to your timesheet, and start fresh with a new focus session.</p>
